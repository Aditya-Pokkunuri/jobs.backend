# Ottobon -- Strategic Use Cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Case 1: The "Bridge the Gap" Candidate

**Scenario:**\
A Junior Developer wants to apply for a **Full Stack Engineer** role
posted by a partner organization.

**The Problem:**\
The user uploads their resume.\
The system detects they are strong in **React (Frontend)** but weak in
**Node.js (Backend)**, which is a required skill.

**Ottobon Solution:**

-   **Immediate Flag:**\
    The *"Skills Required"* pillar highlights the gap in red.

-   **Control Tower Activation:**\       
    The AI initiates a chat:\
    \> "I see you're great with React, but this role requires Node.js.
    Would you like a quick roadmap?"

-   **Human "Tap-In":**\
    The user asks a complex question about how deep their Node.js
    knowledge needs to be.\
    The background expert overrides the AI to say:\
    \> "Actually, for this specific client, they only need you to know
    Express middleware. Don't worry about the rest. Check out our 'Prep'
    tab for a middleware guide."

**Outcome:**\
The user studies the specific *Prep* material and applies with
confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Case 2: The Career Pivoter (Resume Reframing)

**Scenario:**\
A Customer Support Agent wants to move into a **Client Success Manager**
role.

**The Problem:**\
Their current resume is full of technical support keywords (tickets,
bugs, troubleshooting) which don't match the new job description.

**Ottobon Solution:**

-   **System Generation:**\
    The *"How to Build the Resume"* pillar auto-generates a guide for
    this transition.\
    \> "Replace 'Resolved Tickets' with 'Managed Client Relationships'."

-   **AI Assistance:**\
    The user asks:\
    \> "How do I rephrase my experience with angry customers?"

**Outcome:**\
The user rebuilds their resume using the system blueprint and passes the
initial screening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Case 3: The "Niche Skill" Workshop Conversion

**Scenario:**\
A company posts a job requiring **Rust Programming**, a rare skill.

**The Problem:**\
95% of developers only know C++ or Python and are about to leave the
page.

**Ottobon Solution:**

-   **Detection:**\
    The system detects hesitation on the *"Skills"* tab.

-   **Control Tower Strategy:**\
    \> "Hey, noticed you're looking at the Rust role. It's tough to find
    resources for this."

-   **The Offer:**\
    \> "We have a 2-day workshop starting Saturday that covers exactly
    what this company asks for. Interested?"

**Outcome:**\
Ottobon monetizes via the workshop and upskills the user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Case 4: The "Nervous Expert" (Interview Prep)

**Scenario:**\
A Senior Architect applies for a VP-level role.

**The Problem:**\
They haven't interviewed in 10 years and lack confidence.

**Ottobon Solution:**

-   **The "Prep" Pillar:**\
    Behavioral questions tailored to the organization.

-   **Control Tower Support:**\
    \> "I'm really nervous about the culture fit round."

-   **Human Coaching:**\
    \> "For a VP role, focus on Strategic Decision Making over technical
    depth. Try our Mock Interview module in the Prep tab."

**Outcome:**\
The user gains executive-level confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Use Case 5: The "Passive Browser" Engagement

**Scenario:**\
A user logs in casually with no intention of applying.

**The Problem:**\
Passive users typically bounce quickly.

**Ottobon Solution:**

-   **Engagement Hook:**\
    A visual graph compares their skills with the job's needs.

-   **AI Nudge:**\
    \> "Curious about Data Science? You already have 60% of the skills
    needed."

-   **Human Validation:**\
    \> "You just need SQL. Check the Prep section for a guide."

**Outcome:**\
A passive browser becomes an active learner and future applicant.
